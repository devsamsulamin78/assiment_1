                              <p class="card_pera_dec">Code can be incredibly intimidating. It’s something you can only become good at it after hours and hours of practice. Coding is a journey that never ends.

                                   Thus, no school can promise to teach you everything coding involves…and those that do are lying. The field of coding changes far too rapidly and consists of way too much information to make learning everything an attainable reality.</p>
